DSCounter/"Green Sign Soapstone"
James Stanko
Created January 2017, discontinued due to visual studio no longer supporting c++ windows form applications.

Intention was to create a stopwatch program where user could fill in the laps with their own text.
This version reached a point where the primary stopwatch functionality works (start/stop/lap/reset), but didnt have that customizable option and instead has video game placeholders.
The last option it has is to stop the timer when the last lap is reached in a set, however this is functionally primitive and hard-coded.
A compiled executable of the latest working version is included in the Debug folder, and should work as a standalone exe on other machines (won't throw "Msvcr110.dll is missing from this computer")
